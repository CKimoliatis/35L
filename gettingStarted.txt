1.  git clone the repo 
2.  Go into /35L and run pip (windows) pip3 install -r requirements.txt
3.  After installing go to /35L/backend python manage.py runserver
4.  If this doesnt work and gives you an error for os means you will need a virtual environment
5.  Go out of the file into the parent of 35L and run python -m venv myvenv (this will create a myvenv environment)
6. Open the environment by doing:
    myvenv\Scipts\activate for windows
    source myvenv\bin\activate for mac
    !! The backslashes could be different i forgot what they were
7. After doing all that go into /35L and do instruction 2. and 3. 
8. Once that works, go to /35L/backend/frontend and do npm i 
9. This will install all dependecies needed for your project
10. After that open 2 terminal tabs, one has to be where manage.py is and run python manage.py runserver
    The other tab has to be in frontend where package.json is in and do npm run dev
11. Go to your browser and run 127.0.0.1:8000
